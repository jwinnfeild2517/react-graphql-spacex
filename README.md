# Space X Launch Tracker

Our goal is to make a React app with a list of the past SpaceX launches along with an associated details page. Data is provided via the [SpaceX](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) GraphQL API and. We use the [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/) Provider and the useQuery hook to access data from the frontend.
